# Temporal dynamics and functional redundancy in the microbiome of a macroalgal foundation species
The scales at which microbiomes of marine hosts vary in time and space, and the biotic and abiotic drivers of variation are poorly understood. Functional redundancy can maintain key microbe-mediated processes despite taxonomic variation, but it is unclear if these functions are stable following changes in the host or host environment. We repeatedly sampled the microbiome of the same Fucus distichus individuals through time and compared host-associated bacterial (16S rRNA gene), eukaryotic (18S rRNA gene), and functional (shotgun metagenomic) diversity to source pools of microbes in the surrounding environment. Temporal variation in biotic filters (the host) and the abiotic environment were partially decoupled by sampling co-occurring host individuals at different life stages throughout the study. Synchronous temporal turnover in microbial taxa occurred at the host population-level and followed a seasonal trend. At the individual level, variation in specific ASVs was high and minimally explained by differences in host ontogeny or spatial distance within the host population. In contrast, interindividual variation in microbial functional repertoire was low, suggesting high functional redundancy. We also observed consistent and habitat-specific temporal turnover in microbial functions indicating functional change is driven by seasonal variation across host-associated and abiotic intertidal habitats. This research makes a novel contribution to understanding the selective filters determining microbiome compositional dynamics and functions in an ecologically important marine host.
